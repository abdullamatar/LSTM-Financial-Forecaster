    "- As an overview, the idea behind this model architecture is to assign weights to selected features; in this case the **open** and the **highest** price the stock reached for a given day were selected. These learned weights represents the model's view on the importance of said features from recent and previous time blocks and how they affect the price in the coming day(s).\n",
    "- This model will be trained on ADNOC's stock price history and the weights it learns will be saved and used via a transfer learning approach to be tested on and predict Borouge's future stock price.\n",
    "- This was done due to the lack of training data for Borouge's stock price as it (relatively) recently IPO'd\n",

    "- RNNs are able to use recently seen past information however, they cannot do so with data that has larger time windows between its elements. This is where the LSTM architecture comes into play.\n",
    "- This is another one of the distinguishing features of using the LSTM architecture, its ability to 'remember' or erase parts of previously seen data in a window (or timestep).\n",
    "- By creating a window our training data will be turned into an array of arrays divided into chunks of N, where N would be the size of our timestep/window.\n",
